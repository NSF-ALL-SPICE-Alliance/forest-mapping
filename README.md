## Overview 

This work took place during June 2024 during the SPICE Summer Data Science Institute. Students begun by learning how to utilize the [eo-learn](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-learn) python package to process data from Sentinel 2. Next, with inspiration from forest-map notebook in the [eo-learn examples repository](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-learn-examples), students applied a machine learning model to their data in order to analyze trends in deforestation 
in Indonesia and Myanmar and monitor wild fire activity in New Zealand.
