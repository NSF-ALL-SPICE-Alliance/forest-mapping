Student stipends for this work were funded by the Pacific Intelligence Innovation Initiative ([P3I](https://hawaiip3i.org/))




## Overview 

This work took place during June 2024 during the SPICE Summer Data Science Institute. Students begun by learning how to utilize the [eo-learn](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-learn) python package to process data from Sentinel 2. Next, with inspiration from forest-map notebook in the [eo-learn examples repository](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-learn-examples), students applied a machine learning model created by [Benjamin Bishke & the European Space Agency PhiLab](https://philab.esa.int/) to their data in order to analyze trends in deforestation 
in Indonesia and Myanmar and monitor wild fire activity in New Zealand.
